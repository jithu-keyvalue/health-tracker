📝 Notes  
--------
- 🔢 float()  
  Converts user input (which is always a string) into a number.

  ```python
  height = float(input("Enter your height: "))
  ```

- 🤔 if-elif-else  
  Use conditional logic to branch based on values.

  ```python
  if condition:
      ...
  elif other_condition:
      ...
  else:
      ...
  ```
