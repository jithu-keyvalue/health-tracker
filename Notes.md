📝 Notes  
--------
- 🧩 Functions  
  Use `def` to define reusable blocks of logic.
  ```python
  def greet(name):
      print(f"Hello, {name}!")
  ```

- 🔁 return values  
    Functions can return results using return.
  ```python
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```

- 🧪 Why use functions?
  - To organize your code
  - To avoid repetition
  - To make each part easier to understand and test
