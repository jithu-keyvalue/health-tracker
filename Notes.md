📝 Notes  
--------
- 🧍‍♂️ input()  
  Pauses the program and waits for the user to type something.

  ```python
  name = input("Enter your age: ")
  ```  
  The message inside input() is shown as a prompt.

- 📦 Variables  
  You can store the result of input() in a variable to reuse it.

- 🔤 f-strings  
  Use f"..." to insert variables directly into strings.
  ```python
  print(f"You are {age} years old!")
  ```
