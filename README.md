Step 04 – Track Hb by Date
===========================

💭 Problem / Pain  
-----------------
You're only checking hemoglobin once — but you want to track it over time to see how it's changing.

🛠️ Tasks  
---------
- Fix the issue in saving Hb value in dictionary

✅ Check  
--------
- Run `python program.py`
- Enter multiple dates + Hb values
- See output like:
  `{'2024-03-01': 13.2, '2024-04-01': 13.7}`
