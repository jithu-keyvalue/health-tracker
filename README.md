============================

💭 Problem / Pain  
-----------------
You want to check if your hemoglobin level is okay — but right now, the program doesn’t know how to evaluate anything.

🛠️ Tasks  
---------
- Fix the issue while printing the Hb status

✅ Check  
--------
- Run `python program.py`
- It asks for gender and Hb
- It prints if the value is normal or low (based on basic rules)

🧠 What You Learnt  
------------------
- How to read numeric input from the user  
- How to use `if-else` for conditional logic  
- How to combine multiple inputs and print dynamic results  


🧪 Hb Level Check Rule
----------------------
- If male and Hb < 13 → "Low"
- If female and Hb < 12 → "Low"
- Else → "Normal"
